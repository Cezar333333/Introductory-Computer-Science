## General Project Development Routine, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-ComputerScience/Project-Development-and-Resources">Click Here for more details</a>
- Case Study, Paper and Pencil: Behaviors, Functions, and Layout using 11x17 Paper
- Case Study, Pseudocode: Imagining the Output Space
- Case Study, Language Functions and Algorithms to achieve "Behaviors and Functions"
- Prototyping: split project into smaller pieces to code and test through console and then main output (usually Browser Tab in Chrome or Canvas in Processing-Java)
- Full App: Assembled pieces and debugging
