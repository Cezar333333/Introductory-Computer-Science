# Final Project & Course Summary
Main Ideas and Concepts linked to Exemplar Code or Programs used for teaching

Purpose: side-load to Android using all course lessons
- **Final Project can replace all previous assignments** and grades if concepts and ideas are repeated and work in student's chosen project
- **Ethics**: develop and test a device app and own your device permissions
- Time extensions are available, see Mr. Mercer

*Side-load your music player to play your owned content and keep your own permissions*

Using Processing to side-load (Instructions and Reference): https://android.processing.org/index.html

Getting Ready to Side Load, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/BYOD#java-processing-java-processing-android-and-pure-java">Click Here for the BYOD Repository, Android Section</a>
 - Acer Tablet <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/BYOD/tree/master/AcerHelloWorld">Hello World Example, from BYOD Repository</a>

Grading Issues and Receiving Help during the final project (similar to a final exam)


**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Summary of Main Concepts from Course (repeated in Final Project)
- Sounds and/or Music (from Music Player)
- GUI able to communicate with display ( using fullScreen() )
  - Including instructions for "How to Use"
  - Might be simple website
- Interactions
  - Buttons: 2D Shapes, mouse, keyboard, hover-over and other pre-feedback
  - "If this ... then that"
- text & text features
- images & image features
- colour
- Random features (using colour, etc.)

# Ideas to Include

See BYOD to customize your computer and Processing-JAVA, Processing-Android

See Textbook "Rapid Android Development: Build Rich, Sensor-Based Applications with Processing"
- Mr. Mercer has a copy at his desk
- Uses Ketai Library, see http://ketai.org/

Side-loading Android debugging changes:
- Touch Screen: try changing ```mouseX``` & ```mouseY``` to ```pmouseX``` and ```pmouseY```

Main Concepts to Develop through final project
- Case Study, paper prototype (able to discuss design, layout, features, and program behaviors like sounds, clicks, and keyboard presses)
  - Includes ```if this, then that``` Smart List
- GUI Layout and design with ```rect()``` and other 2D Shapes (minimum is rectangle layout)
- Pseudocode layout of program, following on of programming methodologies
  - Flat, static mode in Processing-JAVA
  - Structured Programming using
    - Global Variables
    - ```void setup() {}```
    - ```void draw() {}```
    - Additional Listeners like keyboard or mouse interactions (```void keypressed() {}``` or ```void mouseClicked() {}```)
  - Additional Procedural Programming utilizing TABS to group code (mostly non-return procedures, ```void```, introductory-level procedural programming)
- Flat prototyping of features
