# Ideas to Include

General List for App Building (Option of Android-side Loading)
- Calculator Problems
- Maze Solver (what is available, simplest solution)
- Rock Paper Scissors (Video Introduction, Maths of 3rds similar to Monty Hall Problem, Coding Random)

Music Player
- Owning own content
- Permissions to device are what you program
- Able to setup a music server and have your device (what you program) access this server (using Minim)
- Is like a four week final exam: build and debug based on
  - Previously written code
  - GitHub Resources
  - Online Resources
  - Minim Web presence and resources
  - Asking friends
  - Asking Melanie
  - *If you want for Mr. Mercer to answer you questions and debug code* you will use a lot of class time and eventually not have time to finish your final project
- Side loading to a device
- Using a RPi (or similar) Server
