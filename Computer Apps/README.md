# Computer Apps

Purpose: two final programs
- Drawing Program & Music Program
- Constant review of these GUIs and IOPs
- "Do you have a similar project you would like to make as a final project?"
  - Approve this with Mr. Mercer
  - For example: a drawing program that uses sound effects and has a choice of background music?

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Progressions
- Finding Processing.org, Finding the Reference Manual (using `ctrl-F`), and beginning a main file
  ```JAVA
  //Global Variables
  void setup() {}
  void draw() {}
  ```
- Switching between static and dynamic programming (prototyping GUI and managing visual data)
  - Case Study: laying out drawing program, music player, measles
  - All in 2D Shapes
  - Commenting in Pseudocode to emphasize how program will execute code (linear order)
- First Week Projects
  - Quit Button, if decision("Hover-over" will be done later) & introducing grid interpretation of screen
  - Canvas, size()
  - Happy Face Project, fullScreen(), GUI Ratios and Layering
  - Quit Button, various examples
  - Adding Text in the Quit Button
  - Adding Images

Future Ideas
- Chess Board, nested FOR Loops

---

# To Include

#### 2D Shapes
- Happy Face, size() to fullsize()
- Happy Face Measles
- Happy Face Measles with Button Code (need to case study first to see Boolean Boxes, verify with code)

Quit Button Teacher Files, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V_HPscgLpOFraL7TtETbbtGwdvU70Nbt">Click Here</a>

#### Loading Images
- Introduction to Rock Paper Scissor's Game (possible project to Cell Phone or mobile device)

---

Happy Face & Measles: see program for ideas
- GUI ratios: introduction to boundaries of different display geometry
- Variable declaration and assignment separations
- Introduction to 3 main parts of .pde file
  - Name matches folder
  - void setup()
  - void draw()
- Rewriting program so variables and comments "read like a book"

  Download Program, Show Reference Page, Start a Canvas

  Beginning Processing Java
  - Starting Processing, possible download'
  - Lesson on size(), fullScreen(), print(), displaywidth, displayHeight, ```\n``` and other character escapes

Various Teaching Images to Review, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jF7fhTiNUM02L22YSlYBXjI7l5XIvw9h">Click Here</a>

Celebration Card:
- Finish Snowman with 2D Shapes, Quit Button, Text, and Images
- Make this a Celebration Card & Address it to someone!

Returning to Happy Face Measles when working on the Music Player ...
- use random and button-like inequalities to draw measles into specific parts of the face
- similar problem to coding mouseClick to specific areas of the screen
- Need part of a class to update Happy Face code to
  - proper laying
  - increased drawing with stroke(), noStroke(), strokeWeight(), and resetting to defaults

Happy Face Measles with Button Code
- Purpose: to understand why random() is producing a rectangle
- Introduction to sub programs (repeated code), knowing how to copy and paste without copying and pasting

---

- Create Quit-Button, with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)
  - Start with Paper Folding Activity, try to get top left corner (same as X in WINDOWS)
- Use the two programs to change develop understanding of Global Variables, setup(), draw(), and listener or mouseClick()
  - Variables used when code repeats (like circleDiamter for face, eyes, measles; red colour
  - Laying is emphasized with what shapes to draw first
  - Quit-Button can use a hover-over (introduce decision for fill colours)
  - Quit-Button will be included in Boilerplate as procedure (introducing code written once and used where-ever)
Happy Face Variables and Comments to make code readable
- Reminders
  - size() will separate declarations and assignments
  - variables with random() assignments will also need to be in the correct void
- Advanced: creating TABS and procedures to decrease the amount of typing
- Extra Code for Happy Face, Measles
  - Use Processing.org to figure these out, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Click Here for the Reference Page</a>
  - strokeWieght()
  - noStroke() & stroke()
  - Explore other processing functions for drawing face (research)
- Measles Program will break without proper declarations and assignments ( after setup and inside draw() )

Teaching Strategy: 3 Java Compiler needs to run a program (demonstration with no words)
Teaching Strategy: demo with no words: layering the eye (use

  Need
Gather code reviewed in 2D Shapes
Discuss vocabulary and ideas with code
Create one-page handouts for these
See Alternate Cue Cards Assignment for Coding Concepts
- In SP2 Final Assignment (leads to Intermediate CS)


For Example
2D Images PsuedoCode to full program
- rect(), ellipse (), line()
- size, width, height, operations to get coordinates
- fullScreen(), Print(), displayWidth, displayHeight, fractions & ratios
- fill(), noFill(), noStroke(), stroke()

2D Text
See DOCs in Folder

2D Images
See DOCs in Folder

Concepts with these examples
- Drawing 2d Shapes creating a form
- Layering 2D Shapes to create perspective or action
- Printing text in rectangles (i.e. DIVs in a webpage)
- Automatically sizing font for text in a webpage
- Creating mouse-click buttons with hover-over effects, like a quit button

- Inserting images with and without aspect ration
- Using effects like tint and transparency

Images (needs WHILE Loops, FOR Loops gets too complicated
- what are the calculator steps to make these calculations
  to make the image bigger or smaller
- these steps are repeated
- these repetitions are a FOR Loop
- Students do this all the time with Guess and Check

Final Exam: Music Player
- GUI design: mix of mouse-based (touch screen) buttons with 2D Shapes creating user experience
  - Including Images and Colours
  - Random Feature (must be included somewhere, even in randomized colours)
- Understanding how a MAIN file will organize code, in a general sense
  - Global Variables, Local Variables
  - Java Compiler requirements: Folder Name, void setup(), and void draw()
  - Additional Listeners: keyPressed, mouseClicked, etc.
- Demonstrating general behaviors:
  - Power Button (exit)- play & pause
  - stop
  - next & previous
  - organization of multiple songs
  - organization of sound effects
- Using prototyped programs and lessons to build similarly coded features from Case Study
- Incorporating text and images
- Utilizing ratios and program-display geometry in visual data rendering

Final Exam Alternates
- Side-loading main program to Android device (finishing the course with exploring content ownership, ethics, and device permissions)
- Creating a different project without project management from Mr. Mercer

Special Effects: on Processing Website, Image fades in and out

3x3 Home Screen Assignment
- Case Study with Paper Folding
- Declare, Assign Variables differently, following different patterns
- Draw dots and rectangles in `void draw() {}`
  - Practice Sequencing with fill()
-

To Do List, create how the 3x3 Home Screen will look at the beginning
- **Remember, will need to create how the home screen will look at the end of each button press**
- Background Color, Images, Text, Buttons
- Create the 3x3 Grid first, then recreate with changes
- Then Move Code
- The clean code with Loops
