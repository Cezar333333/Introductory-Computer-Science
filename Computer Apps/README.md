# Computer Apps

Purpose: two final programs
- Drawing Program & Music Program
- Constant review of these GUIs and IOPs
- "Do you have a similar project you would like to make as a final project?"
  - Approve this with Mr. Mercer
  - For example: a drawing program that uses sound effects and has a choice of background music?

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Progressions
- Finding Processing.org, Finding the Reference Manual (using `ctrl-F`), and beginning a main file
  ```JAVA
  //Global Variables
  void setup() {}
  void draw() {}
  ```
- Switching between static and dynamic programming (prototyping GUI and managing visual data)
  - Case Study: laying out drawing program, music player, measles
  - All in 2D Shapes
  - Commenting in Pseudocode to emphasize how program will execute code (linear order)
- First Week Projects
  - Quit Button, if decision("Hover-over" will be done later) & introducing grid interpretation of screen
  - Canvas, size()
  - Happy Face Project, fullScreen(), GUI Ratios and Layering


Future Ideas
- Chess Board, nested FOR Loops

---

# To Include
- Happy Face, size() to fullsize()
- Happy Face Measles
- Happy Face Measles with Button Code (need to case study first to see Boolean Boxes, verify with code)
