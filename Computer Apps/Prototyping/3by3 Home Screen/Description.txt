Use Paperfolding to understand 3 by 3 chart and beginning "coordinates" (ratios)

Build a button in each "square" to interact with other squares
- understand the layering aspects of modifying the square and then redrawing the button

Use 3x3 Board to review buttons, if statements, mouseX & mouseY variables, and inequalities
Students to submit this by creating 9 different buttons that interact with each other (shapes, text, images)

Follow Progression of Programs
- learn to draw rectangles
- create data structure for variables
- learn ratios for fullScreen()
- create button pressing code
- create hover over effect using void draw() {}
- instead of println, add effects through a Boolean Switch to void draw() {}

Advanced: group code into sections
