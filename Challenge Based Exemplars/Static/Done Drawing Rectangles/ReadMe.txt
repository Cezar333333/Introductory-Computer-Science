This also emphasizes Geometry and the importance of display ratios to code to different displays

Expectation
- Recognize initiation can happen before size(), population must happen afterwards
- Multiple ways of coding primitive variables

Additional Functions to introduce (refer to Processing.org for additional parameters)

Program is written around rect()
Illustrates "learning the hardway"
Programming starts with objects (visual data)

Split initiation and popluation around size()
Change one line and make other variables equal to that variable
Population with key-variables (display)
background() introduces gray scale and dark-light modes
stroke(), noStroke()
strokeWeight()
fill(), noFill()
random()
