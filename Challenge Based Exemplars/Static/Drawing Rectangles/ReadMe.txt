This also emphasizes Geometry and the importance of display ratios

Expectation
- Use Key Variables width & height
- Recognize initiation can happen before size(), population must happen afterwards
- Multiple ways of coding primitive variables

Workflow
- 2D Primitive in setup() or draw()
- parameters as variables, initiated in Global Variables
- variable population in setup(), & introduce using TABS to group code, easy addition
  (move away from flat program to ease scolling, etc.)

Leads to text, image, buttons (mousePressed(), etc.)

Also leads to ratio-based coordinates for ther 2D-shapes inside rect()
