Main Project: Android App (purpose is coding to cell phones)
- http://ketai.org/
- control permissions and flow of personal data
- Main Project: After reviewing what is possible with Ketai.org, design a cell phone app for your main project
  - GUI
  - List Behaviors and expectations
  - List data you will need to code
  - What will your touch screen and physical buttons be doing
  - List the other interactions this app will have and when these will be available (clean & minimal GUI)

Creating Computer Environment
- GitHub Account
- LinkedIn Account, connect with others (must be 16)

New Repository and communication with Mr. Mercer
- Option: use GitHub Classroom
- Change the ReadMe.md file and add a message to Mr. Mercer
- EMail the GitHub URL to Mr. Mercer
- Introduce GitHub, Version Control Software, integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
- Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs
  Where are GitHub Servers? WHich countries and locations?
  How far does data travel with every saving of code?
  What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home?
    (permissions and phsycial data updating)

Complete Case Studies, what users will see
1. Hello World & Simple Counting
  - See Algorithms
  - getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
  - Additions: what else would you put on in the console to tell the world using \t and other character escapes
- Note for assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"
2. Draw a rectangle & include all values as if on coordinate plane (ratios better then #'s)
  - Introduce colour or randomized colour here to be used for future assignments
  - Extending "Drawing a Rectangle" to DIVs or Divisions in GUI
  - Similar to Website Design
3. Draw text to a screen
4. Draw images to a screen using aspect ratio (collage project)
  - How to Create a paragraph with images
5. Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
  - Composite Shape using only rect values & sequential layers in visual data
  - Learn that parameters can be formulae based on geometry ratios
6. 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour, text, and images
  - - Introduce Modular Design
  - Population of Variables by FOR and automatic counting
  - Creating a Button controlled by a Boolean and IF
    Adding Hover over
  - Learn Global Variables, setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), mousePressed()
7. Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
8. Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
9. Final Project: using Ketai Library

All programs will be tested on any size window and fullScreen (i.e. Find and Replace)

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

Flat Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
- Hello World
- Draw a Rectangle in Canvas exactly as a paper Case Study (paper folding is acceptable)
- Draw a composite shape using only rect parameters as variables
  - Layering within Measles (sequential code with copy and paste or WHILE Infinite Loop)
- Draw text
- Draw image & aspect ratios

Dynamic Coding Snippets: exemplar assignments
Purpose: introductions to FOR & IF
- Quit Button (illustration of code to copy and paste into all programs)
- Draw a button to control two events ("Do this Not That")
- Adding single song controlled by keyboard or multiple buttons
- Adding sound effect controlled by single button that matches visual data metaphor
- Draw an illusion like "Snow or Rain in Localized Space" or "Measles on a Face"
  - Layering within setup() & draw()
- 3 x 3 Summary Assignment
