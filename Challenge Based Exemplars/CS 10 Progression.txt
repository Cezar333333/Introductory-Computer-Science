Purpose: coding to cell phones
- http://ketai.org/
- control permissions and flow of personal data

Computer Apps
- LinkedIn Account (must be 16)
- GitHub Account

Create new respository, Share it with Mr. Mercer
- Change the ReadMe.md file and add a message to Mr. Mercer
- EMail the GitHub URL to Mr. Mercer
- Introduce GitHub, Version Control Software, integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")

Prompts: will be tested on any size window and fullScreen (i.e. Find and Replace)
- Hello World: getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
- Note: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.)
  Then appear in canvas "exactly"
- Draw a rectangle
- Draw a Composite Shape using only rect values 
  Learn that parameters can be formulae based on geomtery ratios
- Create an illustion like a Snow Globe or Measeles on a Face
  Note: for Measeles on a Face see layering lessons in Dynamic
- Add colour or randomized colour to these illustrations

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

Extending "Drawing a Rectangle" to DIVs or Divisions in GUI
- Similar to Website Design
- Draw text to a screen
- Draw images to a screen using aspect ratio

Shifting to Dynamic Programming in Processing

Assignment: 3 by 3 Home Screen
- Introduce Modular Design
- Poplution of Variables by FOR and automatic counting
- Creating a Button controled by a Boolean and IF
  Adding Hoverover
- Learn Global Variables, setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), mousePressed()

Adding music controlled with keyboard

Adding sound effect - needs button

Specific to Processing-Dynamic: concept of line-by-line execution of code
Layering within Measles (copy and paste or WHILE)
Layering within setup() & draw()
