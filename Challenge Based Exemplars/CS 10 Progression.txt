Purpose: coding to cell phones
- http://ketai.org/
- control permissions and flow of personal data

Computer Apps
- LinkedIn Account (must be 16)
- GitHub Account

Create new repository, Share it with Mr. Mercer
- Change the ReadMe.md file and add a message to Mr. Mercer
- EMail the GitHub URL to Mr. Mercer
- Introduce GitHub, Version Control Software, integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")

Case Studies
- Hello World Text
- Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
- 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour, text, and images
- Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
- Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
- Final Project: using Ketai Library

Prompts: will be tested on any size window and fullScreen (i.e. Find and Replace)
- Hello World: getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
  Additions: what else would you put on in the console to tell the world using \t and other character escapes
- Note: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.)
  Then appear in canvas "exactly"
- Draw a rectangle
- Draw a Composite Shape using only rect values
  Learn that parameters can be formulae based on geometry ratios
- Create an illusion like a Snow Globe or Measles on a Face
  Note: for Measles on a Face see layering lessons in Dynamic
- Add colour or randomized colour to these illustrations

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

Extending "Drawing a Rectangle" to DIVs or Divisions in GUI
- Similar to Website Design
- Draw text to a screen
- Draw images to a screen using aspect ratio

Shifting to Dynamic Programming in Processing

Assignment: 3 by 3 Home Screen
- Introduce Modular Design
- Population of Variables by FOR and automatic counting
- Creating a Button controlled by a Boolean and IF
  Adding Hover over
- Learn Global Variables, setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), mousePressed()

Adding music controlled with keyboard

Adding sound effect - needs button

Specific to Processing-Dynamic: concept of line-by-line execution of code
Layering within Measles (copy and paste or WHILE)
Layering within setup() & draw()
